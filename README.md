GitHub Tutorial Workspace (VS Code first)
========================================

This workspace teaches Git and GitHub step by step. We prefer using VS Code's Source Control and the GitHub extension. Commands are also given for PowerShell.

Files:
- `syllabus.md` - course plan
- `examples/hello.py` - Hello World
- `examples/stars.py` - star pyramid
- `examples/animals.py` - basic OOP

How to use:
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Use the Source Control view (left bar) to see changes, stage, and commit.
3. Use the GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension to make PRs and link issues from inside VS Code.

Tip: If you prefer Git commands, PowerShell examples are shown in each lesson.
