4. Issues, Projects & Workflows
   - Issues, labels, milestones
   - Projects (boards) and linking PRs/issues
   - Templates (ISSUE_TEMPLATE, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)

5. Protected Branches & Code Review
   - Branch protection rules, required checks, status checks
   - CODEOWNERS, reviews, and merging rules

6. CI/CD and Actions
