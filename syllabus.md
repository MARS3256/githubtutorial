Short GitHub & Git Syllabus (VS Code)
====================================

Goal: Teach you Git and GitHub the way teams use them at work. We will use VS Code's built-in Source Control and GitHub features. I will also show the matching PowerShell commands, but the VS Code UI is the primary way.

Modules (simple):

1. Setup & Basics
   - Install Git and VS Code extensions (GitHub Pull Requests & Issues).
   - Use VS Code Source Control to stage, commit, push, and pull.

2. Branching & Merging
   - Make branches in VS Code, switch, merge, and handle conflicts using the editor.

3. Remote Collaboration
   - Forking and cloning (VS Code + GitHub web), remotes, and upstream.
   - Create Pull Requests from VS Code or GitHub web.

4. Issues, Projects & Workflows
   - Create and link Issues from VS Code and GitHub web. Use simple project boards.

5. Code Review & Protection
   - Use branch protection and review flow. Use CODEOWNERS when needed.

6. CI/CD (Basics)
   - Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow. See checks on PRs.

7. Releases & Tags
   - Tagging and making releases on GitHub.

8. Security Basics
   - Use Secrets, Dependabot alerts, and good dependency hygiene.

9. Extras (overview)
   - Submodules, LFS, monorepo notes.

Examples in this repo:
- `examples/hello.py` — Hello world
- `examples/stars.py` — star pyramid
- `examples/animals.py` — basic OOP

How we work:
- For each lesson: short explanation, a small hands-on change, PowerShell git commands, and the exact VS Code steps to do the same.
- Language: simple and clear (easy to follow).

Next: Lesson 1 is done. Now we will move to Lesson 2: Branching & Merging.

Next: Use the `examples/` folder to run the small scripts and follow Lesson 1 (Setup & Basics).
